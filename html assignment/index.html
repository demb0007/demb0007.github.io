    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>My name is Amel, and I am currently a student studying <strong>Interactive Media Design</strong>  at Algonquin College. 
      Before continuing my studies, I worked as an English teacher, which helped me develop strong communication 
      and presentation skills. I also own a serigraphy workshop where I work with creative production tools, 
      including two <abbr title="Computer Numerical Control">CNC</abbr> machines: a CNC laser cut machine and a 
      CNC router. This experience allowed me to combine creativity, technology, and hands-on problem solving.</p>
    <p>    Outside of school, I like exploring new technologies, working on personal projects, 
            and improving my problem-solving skills. I am currently in my 1<sup>st</sup> year 
            and I am excited to continue learning more about design and development. 
            I enjoy challenges because they help me grow both academically and personally.</p>
