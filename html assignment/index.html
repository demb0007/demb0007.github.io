  <h2> About me</h2>
  <p>My name is Amel. I am currently a student studing <strong>Interactive Media Design</strong> at algonquin college.
    Before continuing my studies, I worked as a teacher of English, which helped me in developing my skills and build strong communication
    abilities. I also own a serigraphy workshop where I work with production tools, including two <abbr title="
      Computer Numerical Control"></abbr> CNC</abbr> machine: a CNC laser cut machine and a CNC router. This experience me to combine creativity, 
      technology, and hands-on problem solving.</p>
      <p>Outside of school, I like exploring new technologies, working on personal projects, and improving my problem solving skills. I am
        currently in my 1<sup>st</sup> year and I am exited to continue learning more about web design. I enjoy challenges because they
        help me grow both academically and personally.
